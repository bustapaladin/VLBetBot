## Usage:

For using the default mode (Mode 4), there isn't much you need to do to setup the bot. You may only need to change the 'reserveAmount' variable.

Here is a rough guide for setting the 'reserveAmount' variable.

Let's say your starting balance is 50,000.
Preferably, you would want to have 2 of the reserve balances, this means you can full-bust 2 times and still have enough to continue.

In our case, if we divide 50,000 by 3 we get 16,666.

To be on the safe side, I would suggest you set the 'reserveBalance' 15,000.
This means every time you earn 30k, 15k will be put aside for withdrawing or when you bust.


If you have any questions, feel free to bring them up with me in the BustaBit chat @CurtisVL!
